    question: 'What is a good conversion rate for Facebook Ads?',
    answer: 'Good conversion rates vary by industry, with e-commerce averaging 1.85%, B2B at 0.95%, finance at 2.35%, and education at 2.85%. Top performers can achieve rates 2-3 times higher. Focus on your industry benchmark rather than overall averages, as conversion definitions and customer journey complexity differ significantly.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How can I improve my Facebook Ads conversion rate?',
    answer: 'To improve conversion rates: 1) Enhance audience targeting precision, 2) Optimize landing page design and load speed, 3) Test different ad formats and creatives, 4) Implement strong calls-to-action, 5) Use retargeting for warm audiences, and 6) Ensure mobile optimization. Regular A/B testing is crucial for ongoing improvement.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why do conversion rates vary between industries?',
    answer: 'Conversion rate variations stem from: 1) Different conversion definitions (purchase vs. lead), 2) Purchase price and decision complexity, 3) Sales cycle length, 4) Target audience characteristics, and 5) Competition levels. Higher-value products typically see lower conversion rates but higher customer lifetime value.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you calculate conversion rate accurately?',
    answer: 'Calculate conversion rate by dividing total conversions by total link clicks, expressed as a percentage. Ensure accurate tracking by: 1) Properly setting up Facebook Pixel, 2) Defining clear conversion events, 3) Using consistent attribution windows, and 4) Segmenting by campaign objective and audience type.',
